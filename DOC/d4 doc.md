## Problem Statement
Foot and Mouth disease is affecting the livestock sector of agriculture, as South African farms can’t efficiently track and manage it.
### Sub problems:

1. **Filing Symptoms:**
Many farms struggle to keep track of the symptoms of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) seen in their cows. This means farm managers don't know which cows are sick and which ones are healthy. Without this information, the disease can spread quickly and be hard to control. By not keeping tabs on symptoms, farm managers can't take the right actions to stop the disease from spreading.

2. **Tracking inventory:**
When farm owners can't keep track of each animal's health daily, it's hard to know which ones are affected. This makes managing FMD tougher because they might miss signs of illness and delays in treating sick animals.
<br>

## Proposed Solution
The system will intake cows and monitor their daily health statuses. Workers must complete questionnaires to track each cow's health status. Based on this information, cows are categorized according to their health status as reported by the workers. These questionnaires are compiled into a report for the manager, aiding in informed business decisions regarding FMD management.

The suggested livestock management system intends to solve the difficulty of preventing disease spread, such as Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), by introducing strong tracking and monitoring techniques. By using technology and data management, the system provides various benefits that can help to mitigate the impact of such diseases and improve overall farm management efficiency.

• **Improved Disease Surveillance:** The system logs and registers new cows on the farm, allowing for full tracking of livestock populations. By separating animals based on their classification and health status, farm managers may immediately detect and quarantine possibly contaminated animals, allowing for early intervention and disease management. 

• **Early Detection of Sick Animals:** Workers can identify behavioural changes in cows that serve as early signs of impending illness. The intelligent questionnaire assists professionals in classifying cows based on their symptoms, triggering critical health tests and interventions as needed. This proactive method allows for timely illness treatment and containment, lowering the danger of future transmission within the group of livestock. 


• **Automated Reporting and Decision-Making:** The system creates automated weekly reports summarizing the health inspections completed by employees. These reports offer farm managers with crucial information about the health of individual cows and the entire herd. Managers may make informed decisions, such as introducing quarantine procedures for certain animals or places, using real-time data and trends.
 
• **Enhanced Communication and Task Management:** Workers can utilize a mobile app to log health information, increasing interaction and data-gathering efficiency. The web application allows managers to delegate tasks connected to animal checkups and track their completion status. This streamlined approach provides prompt and thorough monitoring of the health of livestock while also allowing farm staff to collaborate more effectively.

 • **Data-Driven Insights and Analysis:** The web application allows managers to do detailed analyses and visualizations of animal health data. Managers can use advanced data analysis to discover patterns, trends, and danger signs related to disease outbreaks. This data-driven method allows for more proactive decision-making, resource allocation, and disease prevention strategy optimization.

 In general, the proposed management system provides an in-depth solution to the challenge of controlling infectious diseases in livestock farming. The system enables farm managers and workers to apply preventative measures, reduce disease spread, and improve livestock well-being and profitability through integrated tracking, monitoring, and communication capabilities. Finally, this approach helps to ensure the tracking of the health of animals in farms during the outbreaks of diseases such as, Food and Mouth.
